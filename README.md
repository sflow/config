# config

sFlow configuration examples on various platforms.

In these informal examples the sampling-N and polling-seconds are often given as example numbers (e.g. 10000 for sampling-N and 20 for polling-seconds), while the sFlow collector IP address is often given as ```<collector-ip>``` and an address belonging to the switch is often denoted as ```<loopback-ip>```.
